# HTML in Detail

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, defining the elements and their relationships.

HTML uses tags to mark up elements within the document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets `(< >)` and consist of an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between the opening and closing tags represents the element.

Here are some key concepts to understand about HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
- The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
- The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
- The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
- The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- The <h1> element defines a large heading
- The <p> element defines a paragraph
